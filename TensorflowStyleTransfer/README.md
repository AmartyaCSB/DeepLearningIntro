This code re-purpose the pre-trained VGG16 convolutional network that won the ImageNet competition in 2014 for image classification to transfer the style of a given image to another. All using just TensorFlow.


Language
============

* Python 3


Note
============
* For GPU with 2GB Memory will have issue running on image size 512x512.
* Use smaller size like 256x256


Usage
============

python style_transfer.py
